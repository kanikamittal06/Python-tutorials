# You've finished eating at a restaurant, and received this bill:
#
# Cost of meal: $44.50
# Restaurant tax: 6.75%
# Tip: 15%
# You'll apply the tip to the overall cost of the meal (including tax).
#
# First, let's declare the variable meal and assign it the value 44.50.
#Create the variable tax and set it equal to the decimal value of 6.75%.

#Set the variable tip to decimal value of 15% .
#On line 7, reassign meal to the value of itself + itself * tax. And yes, you're allowed to reassign a variable in terms of itself!

#We're only calculating the cost of meal and tax here.
#Assign the variable total to the sum of meal + meal * tip on line 8. Now you have the total cost of your meal!
